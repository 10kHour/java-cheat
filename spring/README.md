Docs: <http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/htmlsingle/>

<https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot> is an opinionated way of getting started with apps quickly. The `spring-boot-samples/` directory contains tons of examples. `cd` into an example, then:

    mvn install
    java -jar target/*.jar

TODO how to configure port?

Sprint boot is documented at: <http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/>
