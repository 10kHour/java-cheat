# Jasmin

Java bytecode assembler, likely the most popular one.

There is not official assembler from Oracle or assembly language. This is in contrast with .NET which came immediately with an assembler.

There is an official disassembler: `javap`, but Jasmin author says that it is not suitable for computer consumption, only human.
